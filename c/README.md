# c quines

This should contain every valid quine in C, from [my shortest known C quine](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/122856/61563) to complete code bowling quines (bowls over 1000 bytes are in the subdirectory `bowl`).

Fork and PR or open an issue if you'd like to add your quine. But first, make sure it meets the requirements:

 - Must be a full program (include the `main` function, or otherwise define main).
 - Cannot use the filename to store data
 - Cannot pull data from the internet
 - Cannot read its source nor its executable ([thanks, Dennis](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/122136/61563))
 - Must be more than 1 byte
 - Must be system-independent

On top of this, if you manage to beat my 60-character quine, [there is an extended bounty on PPCG.](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/12581/61563)
